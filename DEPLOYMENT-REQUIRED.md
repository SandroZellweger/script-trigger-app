# üöÄ URGENT: Backend Deployment Required

## ‚ùå Current Issue
The Google Apps Script backend at both URLs needs to be updated with our CORS fixes:
- `config.js` URL: `AKfycbz_FtmMuPSaRck2VcgJfzNvcAiCtDFoxKzcKVNZn4z5bF3GkMrVB-2kXNlTVNehQOPl`
- Test URL: `AKfycbyrXtwb_ZZla_9HtOEjyCsTgS9HgIqmzcUNC6lQqIxWAZlZe2bDC44o8d0y7mhXMYPI`

**Neither backend has the CORS fixes we implemented!**

## üîß Required Actions

### Step 1: Deploy Fixed Backend
1. **Open Google Apps Script**: https://script.google.com
2. **Find your project** OR **create new project**
3. **Replace entire code** with `complete-fixed-script.gs`
4. **Save the project**
5. **Deploy as web app**:
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
   - Type: "Web app"
   - Execute as: "Me"
   - Who has access: "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
6. **Copy the new deployment URL**

### Step 2: Update Configuration
After deployment, update `config.js`:

```javascript
// Replace this line in config.js:
scriptUrl: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR-NEW-DEPLOYMENT-ID/exec',
```

### Step 3: Test the Fixed Backend
Use `complete-backend-test.html` to verify all endpoints work.

## üìã Deployment Verification

After deployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No CORS errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Ping endpoint responds with success
- ‚úÖ Calendar names endpoint returns data
- ‚úÖ JSONP endpoints work (no 404 errors)

## üö® Why This Happened

The backend fixes we made are in the `complete-fixed-script.gs` file on your local machine, but they haven't been deployed to Google Apps Script yet. The live backends are still running the old code without CORS headers.

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Deploy the backend** using the steps above
2. **Update config.js** with the new URL
3. **Test with complete-backend-test.html**
4. **Verify calendar-production.html** works without errors

**Status**: Backend deployment required ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Priority**: HIGH - App won't work until backend is updated
